# Marketing Campaign Analysis
This project involves the analysis of marketing data from a fictitious company *Artea* to understand why visitors to the retail site fail to convert, despite healthy engagement metrics. Full information is available in [Artea.pdf](Artea.pdf).

This project makes use of several statistical techniques such as hypothesis tests and randomization checks and is done in R. The [relevant codefile](MRKTA1_markdown_Group%203.Rmd) contains detailed comments and explains the flow of code.
